title:  Intro to OO
summary: |
    Get Object-Oriented!
    
    In this tutorial, we'll get you up and running with classes, objects,
    methods, properties and all that OO stuff by building a real (and epic)
    application where we battle space ships. Woh.
    
    Expect to get really comfortable with object-oriented fundamentals, including:
    
    * Creating a class
    * Instantiating objects (many objects!)
    * Classes verus objects (what's the diff?)
    * Class methods
    * Visibility (that public, private, protected stuff)
    * Type-hinting
    * Class constructors (the `__construct` guy)
    
    Blast off! `#NerdPun`
